# TicketApp - Testing & Verification Guide

Comprehensive testing procedures to verify functionality across all three framework implementations (React, Vue.js, and Twig/HTML).

## üß™ Testing Overview

This guide provides systematic testing procedures to ensure:

- All three implementations work identically
- CRUD operations function correctly
- Authentication systems are secure
- UI/UX consistency across frameworks
- Responsive design works on all devices

## üöÄ Quick Verification Checklist

- [ ] All three apps start successfully
- [ ] Authentication flows work in all frameworks
- [ ] CRUD operations are identical across implementations
- [ ] Design consistency maintained
- [ ] Responsive behavior verified
- [ ] Browser compatibility confirmed

## üìã Framework Setup Verification

### React App Testing

```bash
cd react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Expected Result**: Server starts on http://localhost:5173
**Verification**: Landing page loads with dark theme and navigation

### Vue App Testing

```bash
cd vue-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Expected Result**: Server starts on http://localhost:5173 (or next available port)
**Verification**: Landing page loads with identical design to React

### Twig App Testing

```bash
cd twig-app/templates
# Open home_react_match.html in browser
```

**Expected Result**: Static page loads with identical design
**Verification**: Navigation links work, styling matches React/Vue
